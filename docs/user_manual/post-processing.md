# Plug-ins
Post-processing algorithms can be applied to each DICOM layer as a role of plug-ins. There two types of post-processing algorithms in our software. One is Firmware plug-in which is in-built by our software which cannot be add or remove manually. The other one is Customized plug-in which let user create either directly by themselves or download from our user community. 

## Firmware Functions
Current fireware functions include our patented comprehensive de-identification algorithms. 
De-identification alogrithms, which anonymize DICOM data via fully eliminates personal information, contains three scopes: 
- DICOM tag de-identification
- OCR de-identification
- Head de-identification
