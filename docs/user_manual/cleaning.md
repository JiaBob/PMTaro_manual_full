# Data Retrieval
Data Retrieval allows users to search data across all datasets and projects within the system. Users can specify the DICOM layer they are interested in, limited to Patient, Study, and Series layers, as the Instance layer is not available. Several tags, such as Modality and Series Time, can be used as criteria for series-level data retrieval.

After clicking the Search button, the results will be displayed as a list. By clicking on any result, you can expand it to view more details about that DICOM layer. Additionally, related DICOM thumbnails will be shown below.
